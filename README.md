//This has been a JS Project that was completed in Week 4 of a 12 Week Intro to Software Development course with _nology.

//The requirements were:

  //Accept a minimum of 2 inputs, perform an operation and return the output. 
  //DO NOT USE THE eval() function as this is extremely dangerous.
  
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

//Psuedo Code//
//All buttons allocated to queryselector or elementsbyID

//Number buttons need to display on a screen which will be it's own div.

//Screen should probably have a small and large display area for current and previous calculations

//Number buttons will have an event listener on them that picks up when someone pushes them they will do a function

// Operation buttons will also have an event listener on them that picks up when someone pushes them they will do a function

// Equals button is going to need to pick up which number buttons have previously been pushed, which operator has been pushed and which current number has been pushed and put them all together but NOT using eval.  I imgaine I will do this by storing the first value entered before the operator is pushed as a variable and use it later and use basic JS maths to put it all together at the end.  


//Issues I see happening? Isolating the operator is going to be an issue.
